## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was a little uncomfortable when building this project and this is how I know that I learned something. Now I get why using plain css will be difficult for large projects.

### Continued development

Going forward, I will be focusing on the project structuring and also dive deep into css box model.
